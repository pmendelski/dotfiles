# Git Aliases

## Git pearls

Most interesting and frequently used git magic spells.

```
git start               - Start your next git project the right way.
git pr-prepare          - Prepare a branch to be a non problematic pull request.
git pr-close            - Checkout master and cleanup.
git push-force          - The most secure version of push with force
git push-fix            - Quickly push fixes
git push-conflict-fix   - Resolve conflict with master and push
git sync-all            - Rebase all branches with freshly fetched remotes.
git drop-uncommited     - Drop all uncommited changes.
git stash-all           - Stash all, even untracked.
git log-blame           - Correct way for displaying file annotations.
git cleanup             - Cleanup your repo from garbage
```

## Feature flow

Example of an everyday usage:

```sh
# Start a new feature
git create-branch feature/PROJ-001-new-feature
echo 'important' > abc
git commit-all -m 'Important commit'
echo 'fixup' >> abc
git commit-fixup
echo 'squash' >> abc
git commit-squash HEAD^ -m 'Squash'
git pr-prepare
git push
# Apply some code review fixes
echo 'quick-fix' >> abc
git push-fix
# Feature branch merged!
git pr-close
```

...instead of

```sh
# Start a new feature
git checkout -b feature/PROJ-001-new-feature
git push -u origin feature/PROJ-001-new-feature
echo 'important' > abc
git add -A
git commit -am 'Important commit'
echo 'fixup' >> abc
git commit -a --fixup=HEAD
echo 'squash' >> abc
git commit -a --squash=HEAD^ -m 'Squash'
git fetch
# Make sure there are no conflicts
git rebase origin/feature/PROJ-001-new-feature
git rebase origin/master
# Check whitespaces
git diff-tree --check $(git hash-object -t tree /dev/null) HEAD
# Squash commits
git rebase -i
git push
# Apply some code review fixes
echo 'quick-fix' >> abc
git commit -a --amend --no-edit
git push -f --atomic --force-with-lease
# Feature branch merged!
git fetch
git checkout master
git pull
git remote prune origin
git gc
```
